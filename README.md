# movie-recommendation-system-
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and machine learning concepts. It demonstrates how to process movie datasets and recommend similar movies to a user.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Content-based movie recommendation using similarity measures

Easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook walkthrough
 Installation
Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, you can generate one by running:)

pip freeze > requirements.txt
▶Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step learning:

jupyter notebook getting-started-with-a-movie-recommendation-system.ipynb
Or run the Python script directly:

python movie_recommendation_extracted_code.py
Dataset
This project uses publicly available movie datasets (like TMDB or MovieLens).
Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the project directory before running the notebook or script.

Future Improvements
Add collaborative filtering (user-user / item-item)

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django/Streamlit

Integrate real-time movie APIs
